 🧠 BD-LSC: Bi-Directional Lexical Semantic Change
### A Dataset and Benchmark for Tracking Word Meaning Evolution in Slang and Standard English

---

## 🔍 Overview

**BD-LSC** (Bi-Directional Lexical Semantic Change) is a benchmark dataset for analyzing how word meanings **gain**, **lose**, or **remain stable** over time — across both **standard English** and **slang**.  
It introduces a **bi-directional annotation scheme**, capturing the evolution of word senses across **three time periods (T1, T2, T3)**.

Unlike traditional lexical semantic change datasets that classify only “change” vs “no change,” BD-LSC explicitly distinguishes:

- 🟢 **Sense Gain (SG)** – new meanings emerge  
- 🔴 **Sense Loss (SL)** – old meanings fade  
- ⚪ **Stable (NC)** – meanings remain unchanged  

---

### 🧩 Why BD-LSC is Significant

- 🔹 **First bi-directional model of sense evolution** — captures both *gain* and *loss* of meaning across time rather than simple “change/no-change.”  
- 🔹 **Three temporal slices (T1–T3)** — enable fine-grained tracking of gradual semantic drift across decades.  
- 🔹 **Bridges slang and standard usage** — integrates parallel evolution across formal corpora (COHA/CCOHA) and informal slang sources (Urban Dictionary, SlangSD).  
- 🔹 **Cross-domain composition** — combines literary, journalistic, and social media data for a balanced linguistic spectrum.  
- 🔹 **Explicit sense inventories** — each word has a documented set of meanings linked to time-specific labels (word → sense → temporal tag).  
- 🔹 **Multi-label tagging scheme** — supports simultaneous gain/loss tracking and sense stability marking.  
- 🔹 **High-quality human annotation** — Cohen’s κ ≈ 0.9 across time periods ensures reliability and inter-annotator consistency.  
- 🔹 **Benchmark-ready design** — directly comparable with SemEval 2020, TempoWiC, and DWUG while extending beyond their two-period limitations.  
- 🔹 **Open benchmark for LLMs** — designed to test diachronic embeddings, contextual transformers, and semantic drift detection.  
- 🔹 **Reflects real cultural change** — captures how digital communication and online culture reshape English semantics in both slang and standard registers.
