# 🧠 BD-LSC: Bi-Directional Lexical Semantic Change
### A Dataset and Benchmark for Tracking Word Meaning Evolution in Slang and Standard English

---

## 🔍 Overview
**BD-LSC** (Bi-Directional Lexical Semantic Change) is a benchmark dataset for analyzing how word meanings **gain**, **lose**, or **remain stable** over time — across both **standard English** and **slang**.  
It introduces a **bi-directional annotation scheme**, capturing the complex evolution of senses across **three time periods (T1, T2, T3)**.

Unlike traditional lexical semantic change datasets that classify only “change” vs “no change,” BD-LSC explicitly distinguishes:
- 🟢 **Sense Gain (SG)** – new meanings emerge  
- 🔴 **Sense Loss (SL)** – old meanings fade  
- ⚪ **Stable (NC)** – meanings remain unchanged

### Overview of Target Words and Semantic Change Labels (BD-LSC)
This dataset presents an extended lexical semantic change resource that includes both **standard** and **slang** usages of English words across three time periods (T1–T3).  
Each entry preserves *all raw senses* from the source sheet (“Words_lemmas_after_Filter”) and includes semantic change labels across temporal intervals.

| Symbol | Meaning |
|:-------|:--------|
| 🟢 Gain | New sense(s) or extended usage appeared |
| 🔴 Loss | Older sense(s) declined or disappeared |
| ⚪ Stable | No significant change across the period |
